## 👨‍💻 Employee Income Prediction 💰

### 📚 About

This project provides an end-to-end solution for predicting whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50K. It showcases a complete machine learning workflow, starting from comprehensive data preprocessing and rigorous model evaluation to deployment as a fully interactive web application. The goal is to build a reliable and accessible tool for income prediction.

### ✨ Features

- **Interactive Web App 🌐:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit that allows for:

  - Single Prediction 👤: Enter an individual's details into a form for an instant result.
  - Batch Prediction 📄: Upload a CSV file to get predictions for multiple records at once.

- **Robust Data Preprocessing 🧹:** A complete pipeline that handles missing values, caps outliers, and performs one-hot encoding for categorical features.

- **Advanced Model Evaluation 📈:**
  - Trains five different classification models.
  - Performs in-depth comparison using key metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, and AUC.
  - Includes interactive visualizations to easily identify the best-performing model.

- **Deployment Ready 📦:** All essential assets, including the trained model, scaler, and encoders, are saved for easy reuse and deployment.

### 🚀 Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the repo** 📥
   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/akshayparihardev/employee-salary-prediction.git
   ```
3. **Move into the project directory** 📁
   ```bash
   cd employee-salary-prediction
   ```
5. **Install dependencies** ⚙️  
   _(It's recommended to use a virtual environment)_

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### 💡 Usage

This project is designed for maximum convenience. You can launch the interactive web application directly from the Jupyter Notebook.

- Open the Notebook 📓: Launch the `Employee_Salary_Prediction_App.ipynb` file.
- Run All Cells 🚀: Simply run all the cells from top to bottom.
- Click the ngrok Link ✨: The final cell will automatically start the Streamlit application and output a public ngrok URL. Click this link to open the live web app in your browser.

### 📈 Model Performance

The project evaluates five different classification models to find the most effective one. The Gradient Boosting model was chosen for its superior performance, as summarized below.
